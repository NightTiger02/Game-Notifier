# Game-Notifier
A python game notifier that notifies your phone when your lobby has found a match

# Requirements

You'll need python and pip installed on your computer.

Open a cmd in the installation folder and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies.

Afterwards run the "notify-run register" in the cmd to create a personal channel for your notifications.
Scan the QR code with your phone and subscribe to the channel to get notifications from it.

# Extra Notes

I originally created this code for league of legends but if you replace the content in "accept.jpg" file with a picture of a different accept button, it should work the same.

The code runs indefinitely so I advise to terminate it after coming back to the games.

Enjoy!
